                                simply the Straw Hats, are an infamous and powerful rising pirate crew that 
                                originated from the East Blue, but have various members from different areas. 
                                The crew sailed on the Going Merry,their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 
                                7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship which
                                 was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg even though the members fought over different 
                                 names.</p>
